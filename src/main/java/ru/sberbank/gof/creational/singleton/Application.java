         * for a singleton unless it implements an interface that serves as its type.
         *
         * To maintain the singleton guarantee, you
         * have to declare all instance fields transient and provide a readResolve method.
         * Otherwise, each time a serialized instance is deserialized, a new
         * instance will be created.

         * Attempting to enforce noninstantiability by making a class abstract does not work.
